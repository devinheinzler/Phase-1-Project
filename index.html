    <p class="p">Author's Note:
        The initial list of games you're seeing are my favorite games of all time. These could be games that I 
        just had a lot of fun with, or they could be games that shaped my perception of games as a whole. They 
        range from intense character-building and time investments to precisely honed mechanical skills. But what 
        do they ALL have in common? They belong to my favorite 19,577 hours of my life. I hope you can use this to 
        archive those same favorite hours you've spent in your favorite games :)
